# The Vibe Hive

Take a minute. Breathe. Connect to your surroundings and raise your awareness of the global hackathon consciousness.

Prototyped in a couple of hours as part of a group effort at [Hack the Hackathon v3](https://github.com/hackthackathon/).

Open it on a smartphone and use the device motion sensors. Or [plug in a supported VR headset](https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/introduction/vr-headsets-and-webvr-browsers.html) (with Vive or Rift, try it also on [Supermedium](https://www.supermedium.com)).

Built with [Blender](https://blender.org) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).
